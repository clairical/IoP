Mijn antwoord op oefententamenvraag twee (en een korte blurb voor één want die had ik gemist)
1. Denk toiletten (dank je Flore)
2. Matter enabling the flow of other matter.
	1. In this view infrastructures are only seen as something that creates; but the side of infrastructures that destroy is ignored. A pipeline creates opportunity to transport massive amounts of oil, but it comes at the cost of destruction of, for example, native hunting or fishing grounds. They also can limit flow that used to exist—a platform like Canvas streamlines certain kinds of teacher-student interactions, but does not support others; making it impossible to operate through those alternate means as everything has to be routed through Canvas.
	2. Matter usually refers to physical objects; oil, cars, fish, people; but infrastructures exist in many non-physical ways as well: gender is just as much of an infrastructure as the highway net is.
