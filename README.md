# This
is a collection of my notes and summaries made over the course of IoP.
Feel free to peruse them in your own time whenever you miss a lecture, don't get a text (or don't feel like reading it), or if you're just curious what things I am thinking.
These summaries are a bit ideosyncratic and my lecture notes especially are often very bare boned (whatever was already covered by the readings or my mind I often don't feel like putting down),
but it might just be that you get something interesting from them. (And don't worry, I'll try to have the rest of my lecture notes be a bit more elaborate (I bettered myself starting L4!)).
# These
notes are generally in the Dutch language, but I have prefaced my summaries of the texts with both an English and Dutch language super-summary (also known as an abstract). The files are structured as follows: the top level folders are the weeks, which contain the notes of the lectures (numbered in sequence from the first week), and two subfolders titled r1 and r2. r1 has the readings for the first lecture, r2 has the readings for the second lecture. Filenames that are prefixed with an ! are readings that I have not yet summarised (at all), filenames that are prefixed with ¡ are readings which have been summarised, but that I have yet to write a super-summary for. These are however perfectly usable for those who read Dutch. I will try to fill those holes as much as possible in the coming week(s), but do always feel free to contribute your own writings and thoughts. See the next section for more on that.
# If
you feel like I completely misunderstood a point made in a text or a lecture, or if you think I glossed over something that should not have been glossed over, or for whatever other reason,
feel free to propose changes. If you know git you can simply pull this repo to your markdown editor of choice (I use obsidian), change whatever you like and push it back to the main branch
(I think I will have to approve it but we'll see); or you can also just use the github website and click the pencil to propose changes. If that is not the vibe for you, you can always reach
me at clairical(at)pm.me (that is email, to be clear).
